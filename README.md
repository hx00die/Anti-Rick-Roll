Thank me later.
# How to use
There are two versions (a console and a gui version) you can run them by running the python file or by downloading the zip and extracting it and then double clicking the .exe file.
# Disclaimer
The gui was copied from Keith Galli's tutorial https://youtu.be/D8-snVfekto.
